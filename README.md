# Recommend-Songs
Recommend songs on Spotify based off songs you like/dislike.
Currently takes saved songs as songs you like, and a specific playlist which I dislike as songs I don't like. Then predicts which songs from my Discover Weekly playlist I'll like.

## Requirements
Requires Python 3.6 as spotipy is not compatible with Python 3.7. I use Tensorflow 2.0.0 Beta as well. 

### Ongoing:
I'll be adding more to this over the summer: using more training data, automatically adding the 
recommended songs to a playlist on my spotify account.
