# Recommend-Songs
Recommend songs on Spotify based off songs you like/dislike.
Currently takes saved songs as songs you like, and a specific playlist which I dislike as songs I don't like. The predicts which songs from my Discover Weekly playlist I'll like.

Requires Python 3.6 as Tensorflow/Keras doesn't have support for Python 3.7.

Ongoing project. Will be updating over the summer, adding a requirments.txt etc
